## Objective:
- Build a general understanding of the job market for data-related jobs based on job posts on LinkedIn

## How To Use The Project:
- You need a Jupyter notebook, and an environment with packages listed in the requirements.txt file

## Challenges:
- Although web scraping is legal, LinkedIn does not welcome web scraping on the platform
- LinkedIn has placed mechanics on the platform to prevent web crawling robots by flagging suspicious activites and providing arbitrary naming in most of the HTML headers
- There is not a LinkedIn API that allows developers to get information of posts on LinkedIn Jobs

## Domain Driven Design (DDD)

# Core Domain

To fulfill the main objective of the project, the most common job titles and associated job skills to job posts are primary indications to measure the benchmarks for generalized or specialized job options. A relatively substantial amount of records would provide an insightful overview of the job market and LinkedIn is a resourceful platform to gather information on available work at a given time.
