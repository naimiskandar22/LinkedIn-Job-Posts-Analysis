## Objective:
- Build a general understanding of the job market for data-related jobs based on job posts on LinkedIn

## Challenges:
- Although web scraping is legal, LinkedIn does not welcome web scraping on the platform
- LinkedIn has placed mechanics on the platform to prevent web crawling robots by flagging suspicious activites and providing arbitrary naming in most of the HTML headers
- There is not a LinkedIn API that allows developers to get information of posts on LinkedIn Jobs
